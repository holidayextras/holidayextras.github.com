At Holiday Extras we're keen to contribute back to our local tech community. We found a new way to contribute this December by running a Node.js workshop at the University of Kent. We sent some of our Engineers to help students to get started with the excellent [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io) tutorials.

NodeSchool is a great way to learn everything from the basics of Javascript to performance optimisations. It's command line based and super-simple to set up. You can get going with your first hands-on tutorial in minutes. It offers a smart way to verify your attempts and provide guidance on where you may have made a mistake. 

We already have a great relationship with the University of Kent. HX have run a programme for industrial placement students for five years. Most of our placement students have returned to join us full time after their degrees. Many graduates have found their own way to us, too. We value the role our local Universities play in feeding our local tech community. We want to continue to find ways to support them. 

All the HX Engineers who attended the workshop are Kent graduates. We are also not too old to remember what it was like to be at University and readying ourselves for employment. An aim of the workshop was to introduce students to Node.js. It is a Javascript framework growing in popularity and with plenty of employment opportunities. Another was to provide opportunity to talk more generally about the tech industry and life as an Engineer. 

The engagement of the students who attended the workshop impressed us. They made excellent progress through the tutorials and asked some great questions about the wider industry. We hope to be running more in the future. Many thanks to colleagues at the [Kent IT Clinic](http://www.kitc-solutions.co.uk/) for hosting us!
