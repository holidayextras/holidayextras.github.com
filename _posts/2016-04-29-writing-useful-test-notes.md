# There is no one right way
Let me say straight away: there are lots of different ways to write testing notes and no one method will be best in all situations. Everything from the complexity of the product and the time you have available to the client you're working for and the amount of regulation that they are subject to will determine what works best in each particular case.

Each of the testers at Holiday Extras, despite working closely together, has a slightly different way of making notes. That's fine! The important thing is that we learn from eachother and we're not afraid to adapt our methods whenever necessary. That said, there are some simple rules of thumb that can make notes more useful.

# Notes versus Reports
Firstly, let's clarify the difference between the notes that we make for ourselves during our testing sessions and the reports of those testing sessions that we share with other people. Our private notes are a place to record our observations, ideas and questions during the testing session; they're rough, incomplete and probably difficult for other people to follow. The reports that we share with other people are based on these notes but reformatted and rewritten with the aim of communicating those results.

# Write for your audience
Like any other piece of writing, it's important to have a clear picture of who you're writing for.

# How was this tested?
For a number of reasons, one of the most important questions that testers have to be able to answer is "how was this tested?". 

# What has and has not been tested?

# Balance between thoroughness and speed

# Include evidence when itâ€™s useful
Bearing in mind the infamous "how was this tested?" question, it's tempting to try and collect evidence for each step of every test. However, we also need to find that sweet spot between thoroughness and speed.

# Describe what you expected to see as well as what you actually saw

# Explain the value when making a suggestion

# Explain the user impact where possible

# Make notes easy to scan

# Always include a summary
