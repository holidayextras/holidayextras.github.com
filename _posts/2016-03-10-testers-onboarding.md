excerpt: "How do we go about onboarding a new tester?"

This is a tricky one because everyone is unique and absorbs information in different ways. If they have prior experience within a testing role, do you onboard them differently?
Actually, these two are very similar in reality, you should be showing the same content to both people.

Why? you ask... Well, when you first start in a new job, it’s critical to understand the business itself and how it operates. This is vital for any new starter, not just a tester. The main points to be covered for any new starter within a testing role though, are about communication: how we would write descriptive bug reports without providing too much information; explaining the importance of an issue, allowing them to understand priority; ensuring they utilise the knowledge around them to help understand the cause of an issue. These are just some I thought I’d highlight. As I mentioned above, regardless of experience, these are all pretty crucial when first starting out.

Beyond communication, we want the new starter to understand what platforms we have, what tools we use to test and what environments we have to test in. They also need to understand the methods of testing, what needs checking, the intensity of checking and what they need to be looking out for in a particular piece of work. This is where the new starter needs to learn to prioritise, build a mental model of the affected areas and find a balance between thoroughness and speed.

This is far from easy because being a tester is also about the frame of mind not just the skill set. It’s about thinking outside of a box, imagining there was another box around that box and thinking outside of that one. Of course, this is not always the case, but you understand where that was going...

It’s more than just clicking things, browsing a site and reporting back any visual issues. You need to think from a customer’s perspective, from a user's point of view. This, believe it or not, comes easy for a new starter. Essentially they are the customer, learning how our site and app work with no prior experience. Once you learn all of the above, as humans we become used to it, it becomes habit. It’s like riding a bike, once you’ve learnt how to ride one, you’ll be able to hop straight back on no matter how long you’ve left it. As a tester, we are in a way expected to forget how to use something, we need to approach it as a customer would, potentially someone who has never interacted with our site or possibly someone who’s used it a few times. Of course, we don’t literally forget how to use it, merely change our mindset when testing so that we can cover particular approaches like someone who has had little interaction with our site. This means that as a tester, we don’t just stick to a ‘happy path’, we explore other paths, journeys that don’t just lead to a booking.

So that is just the basic expectations for most new starters. What else do we have in store for them when they join?

First of all we get the new starters to shadow the current testers within the team, sitting with them for maybe a few days or a week. Usually though, they do their rounds and sit with testers, developers and sometimes a scrum master to give them a broad experience of different roles and responsibilities.

We have a process in which we call Mob Checking at Holiday Extras. This means the tester would explore a particular site and occasionally a specific area of that site. This is something we have always been keen on getting new starters to do. It allows them to become familiar with our website and with our app, ensuring they feel confident when carrying out their role.

After the first initial month, they go off to their pod where they’ll start testing in support of the pod’s strategic mission. Software testers never stop learning; we’re constantly building our technical expertise, always obtaining new business knowledge and assisting with improving processes.
