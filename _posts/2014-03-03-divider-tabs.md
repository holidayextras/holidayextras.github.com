##How do you organise your tabs?

A few people have asked me what the plugin is that I store my day to day links in, so I thought I'd post about it!

Since joining the Web Team, I have never in my life had so many tabs open at once.

I have some sort of OCD tendancies, this isn't such a bad thing when it comes to my job role, when it comes to my tabs however, them tendancies drive me absolutely insane, I like to know where everything is.

When I first joined I was discussing an idea about having a way of ordering tabs in a certain manor for quick and easy access and maybe categories. After a little while of discussing this with my Pod, I decided to have a look online for a plugin/extension to help me. There were quite a few out there which I downloaded and tried, but none really done it for me.

Until I stumbled across Divider Tabs, Chrome plugin. This has been a complete life saver since downloading.. I know it wont be to everyones taste but it works for me nonetheless. 

**So what does it do?**
Well for the sake of simplicity, it creates a divider tab which can store your 'favourites' or 'most used' links. You can add however many links into the divider tab and it once you 'lock' the tab it saves them links until you decide to remove them or edit them.
You are able to create as many as you want from what I can see but I only require 4/5 'divider tabs' on a day to day basis.

The way that I have used this is to have cetgories for the links, just like you would in a file cabinet with diffent categories, except this is virtual. 
The categories I have currently are; 
- Email+
- Deployments
- Documents
- Triage

This works for me currently but I can imagine in time, this will become bigger.

Inside the email tab I have my GMail and MyHX, so the bare basics.
Inside Deployments, I have the likes of github, Travis CI, TeamCity etc
Triage consists of different links for my pod sprint board and a few other sprint boards/kanban board.

If I click any of the links inside the tab, it opens it in a new tab as you'd expect.
If I then close that link, it still remains in my tab, so it's always there.

No you are probably wondering why I don't just save these as 'favourites' or 'bookmarks'.. Well thats because I have far too many bookmarks and favourites to even do this, it would require time to go through and find the specific one. 
I know exactly where my link is and in which category it would come under. 

**Why have both divider tabs and bookmarks/favourites?**
Ideally I would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks/favourites and just use Divider Tabs, but this isn't possible. If I were to do this, unlocking and locking each tab would open all the links inside of this category for me to edit or remove at my own will, the problem with this is that it would spam my chrome and probably crash it at the same time. 
I have found my 'happy place' with this plugin, everyone will be different though!

I still walk around this office today and when I see an excessive amount of tabs open I just feel the urge to organise it for that person, but as I said before, It might not be everyones cup of tea.

I hope this is of use to someone out there!
