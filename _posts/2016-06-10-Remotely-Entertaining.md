excerpt: Remote working is not that scary, lots of useful tips and guidance on how we do it at HX!

So our Web team has expanded to Sofia in Bulgaria, and they are members of our Scrum teams. With this change to our team dynamics we have learnt how to work remotely really well and of course we still have more areas for improvements. Last week we delivered our ambitious keynote on remote working at #HXConf which definately highlighted some of the challenges . . this was intentional ;). This blog is a follow up from that to highlight the key points made during the session and some more.

Organising a call can be extremely simple as long as everyone is on the same page, as a business we use google calendar which organises our calls for us. The benefits are; add your invites, they get a notification in advance, you can check calendars to check availability and google create a shared accessible link to host the call, and the green bars in the right hand corner do a sound check for you! Thanks Google!

Part of the organisation which Google cannot complete is the equipment and environment setup so here are some tips:

- Use good equipment, desk speakers and microphones if in a group.
- Individuals calling in, use good headsets that restrict background noise (Our IT department issue some really good quality headsets).
- If you do not have the equipment you need get it ordered! (James Penning is our go to guy for this!).
- Think about your environment, you don’t want to have a remote call in a loud office where you will distract others and the background noise will distract the messages on the call.
- Make sure your equipment is set up properly, two places to check your google call settings and the default setup of your machine - change both if you are not sure.
- The quality of the call will depend on the quality of the internet connection - use ethernet or strong WIFI connections - in one person in the call has a ad connection it will impact all ends of the call.
- Sometimes if the microphone and speaker are two close you can get an extremely distracting echo of your own voice, and we all hate the sound of our own voice!
- Be organised with the set up otherwise it can cut into your meeting time.

Putting your remote worker first is key to working effectively and making the remote member of the team feel involved and valued. Try to put their needs first, actively ask questions and encourage engagement. If you are the remote worker speak up, let the team know if you are finding the call challenging for whatever reason.

Also think about Time Zones, try to organise meetings at times that are suitable for all individuals and try to spread out meetings, you tend to use up more energy following conversations remote so don’t organise them closely together!

Engagement is really important so try to make the remote workers feel like they are not at a disadvantage, use multiple cameras to show what is happening the room, it is much easier to follow a conversation if you can see the body language. Think about creative ways to collaborate - we have had some great tools and electronic boards introduced to share ideas on, oh and don’t forget screen share on google hangouts.

Think about how best to use the equipment, desk microphones have a limited range so think about the how you are projecting your voice so you can be heard clearly. Additionally have you ever been in a meeting where there are two conversations happening . . . it is so hard to follow. This is multiplied when listening in one a remote call.

Oh and one final point: our web team now we have two different types of remote meetings:

- An already established team starting to work remotely.
- A new member of the team working remotely with new people, this introduces more challenges because the team familiarity is not yet established, making that individual feel part of the team sooner will create a more effective team!
