Cyclops(X-men) and Uncle Bob/Elon Musk

### What attracted you to a career in tech?
Games, particularly Warcraft 3: TFT

### What would you do if you didn't have to work for a living?

Don't do it if you don't love it.

### How did you get into tech?
I quit university and started working as an intern front-end web developer. Academia was just too slow and boring for me. My first boss told me that "Appetite comes with eating" and I've been hooked on engineering ever since :)

### What has being a Developer taught you?:
To keep tinkering and never stop looking for solutions. We work in an environment that makes almost anything possible - as long as you are ready to put the effort in. This attitude makes you more creative in all other fields of life.

### What advice would you give to remote workers?
Focus on building relationships and connections. The modern style of communication and work processes make it easy for people to become isolated. We have great tools and platforms for collaboration but they weaken the need for genuine chit-chat which is essential for bonding with team-members.

### What advice would you give to teams who have remote workers?
Strive to include remote workers in any sort of communication (not just official meetings). The innocent small-talk before a meeting starts, for example, may seem like a waste of time but is important for bonding - don't mute your microphones before the meeting starts ;)

### What most excites you around the future of technology?
The huge potential that is being realised as we include more people in engineering. Imagine the unleashed creativity and solutions to real-world problems that marginalised groups of people can build once they become empowered by technology!

### What most excites you around the future of technology?
AI is one of the most exciting things going around technology at the moment I think; personal assistance, self driving cars and even AI driven logo designer and much more. AI is also interesting from another point of view, self knowing how much really we know about ourselves as human beings.

### What is it you like about working in tech?
Working in tech is like playing with lego and solving riddles, so if you like solving problems and building stuff you will like working in tech.

### What is the biggest challenge working in tech? What is the best part of working in tech?
The biggest challenge and the best part of working in tech is the change and this is the only constant in the tech world.

### How did you get into tech?
I wasn't tech savvy initially, I had a PC but didn't do much on it other than browsing the web, reading stuff and playing online games. When I was nineteen, I accidentally got to a HTML tutorial and printed out "Hello world" in a browser. That was the first time I opened the source code of a web page and thought to myself "this is interesting…" and I've stayed on this ever-learning journey since.

### What has being a Developer taught you?:
It has taught me that everything is possible if you put effort into it and that the details matter, also that every activity is a craft and an art if you really put your heart into it.

### What advice would you give to remote workers?
The best advice I could give is to be open in your communication as much as you can. Give regular feedback throughout the day on what you're doing and what is your plan for the next thing you're jumping on. Being remote brings challenges but communicating what blocks you will help your team to be aware and they will help you.

### What attracted you to a career in tech?:
I initially started with very simple stuff like writing HTML, then a bit of CSS, then some JavaScript and so on. This was just a hobby for me so at some point it was pretty natural to just make it into a way of living. I'm living the dream.

### What would you do if you didn't have to work for a living?
I would still be writing code for sure as I love doing that but I would probably focus on software in the public interest.

## Nikola Filchev

### Time at HX
10 months

### How did you get into tech?
I've always been good at maths and I used to be a semi-pro in StarCraft: BroodWar (like going to tournaments such as World Cyber Games, etc.) but before that when I was 10-11y.o. I was creating maps with complex logic in that game. The way of creating maps is incredibly similar to writing code or algorithms.

### What has being a Developer taught you?:
To ask people if they tried turning it off and on again.

### What do you like about working at HX?
People in HX look like they really like and have fun in what they are doing. There's a really friendly vibe in the office that can even be felt remotely.

### What would you do if you didn't have to work for a living?
I would go in the forest and pretend to be a tree or as people say 'Living the dream!'

### How did you get into tech?
I've always liked to build and repair all sorts of gadgets since my childhood. Tech is like a never ending adventure - no matter if in the end you've built something successfully or not, you always learn from the experience. Tech is an inevitable part of our modern lifestyle so I've always felt it's kind of natural fit for me.

### What has being a Developer taught you?
Things aren't easy and I have to put some effort and time in if I want to get something done. I have to be persistent and not give up on the first couple of times when something doesn't work. Also that I have to prioritise, because otherwise I could never do everything I want to do or learn in a single lifetime.

### What is it you like about working in tech?
Building tools that make people's lives easier and more fun.

### Time at HX
13 months

### How did you get into tech?
I've always been curious since childhood about how things work, what are the links between different components and systems and how they react and interact with each other. I want to know how the Universe work :)

### What most excites you around the future of technology?
Discovering and exploring the secrets of the Universe - unified theory of everything which would help us understand the quantum mechanics and the cosmos which would help us achieve things like cold fusion, space travel, etc. It really excites me finding a way to travel to other planets/stars/galaxies (ftl drives, warp drives, going through wormholes?).
Really scared of AIs taking over and the prospect of no privacy at all.

### Who are your heroes (tech or not tech related)?
Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking; IronMan and Batman :) (see the pattern?)

### What would you do if you didn't have to work for a living?
Travel around the world. Assuming "don't have to work for a living" means I got enough funds I'd like to focus on making the world a better place and the future better for the next generations.
