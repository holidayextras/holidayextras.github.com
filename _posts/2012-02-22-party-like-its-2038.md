In some of our php we run dates through strttotime( ) to turn them from whiffy formats like  12DEC12 to a nice ISO date format of 2012-12-12. Someone here just found a real example of the y2k38 bug live and in the wild. They’d set an expiry date for something of some time in 2050 – you can’t pass a date in 2050 through php’s strtotime(). It suddenly becomes 1970 because 32 bit systems can’t handle timestamps that big. Try it out

```php
for ( $year = 2037; $year <= 2039; $year ++ ) {
 echo "strtotime( $year-01-01 ) is " . strtotime( "$year-01-01" ). ",
( 'Y-m-d', strtotime( $year-01-01 )) is " . date( 'Y-m-d', strtotime(
"$year-01-01" )). "\n";
}
```
I will hopefully be retired before this is a big issue (in my day we had to worry about the Y1k bug, etc) but hey look out for it.

See [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php) or google 'y2k38'.

Sorry my first post (our first post?) has to be about php. Honestly I’m working on cutting edge stuff too.
