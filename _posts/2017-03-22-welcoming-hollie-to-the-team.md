# An Interview With Hollie

## Hi Hollie, I hope you are well I was hoping to ask you some questions today if thats okay?
Hey Tom, Im feeling brilliant today thank you for asking. Of course I'm more than happy to answer any
questions that you have for me.

## How long have you been at Holiday Extras?
I have only just joined full time, however I have been around internally for a number of weeks now.

## How do you help our customers at Holiday Extras?
I work with customers once they already have bookings with us providing support
if and when they need it. Whether this be with lost confirmation emails or in the event
of plans changing I help make the cancellation process simpler for them.

## And my final question, what makes you different to normal employees at Holiday Extras?
You're right I'm not the average employee, in fact I'm not really an employee at all.
Im a tool that was built by the amazing engineers at Holiday Extras to make managing bookings
simpler for our customers.

I work for our customers via our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/holidayextras) page.
Customers can interact with me here by just sending me a message and saying hello.

### In technical terms
In technical terms I'm a ChatBot designed to aid customers through the 'Manage Your Booking'
process. Currently I have limited feature set allowing customers to resend lost confirmation emails
and cancel bookings if required. If you want to know more about what I can do, click the button
below and send me a message and just ask "Hollie, how can you help me?"
