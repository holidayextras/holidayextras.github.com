## Too many to-dos
During the last few months I've found myself having more and more things to do. I've tried a host of different to-do apps including [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/), [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) and [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) but none of them seem to _**stick**_ as well as my Post-it solution below...

In all seriousness I just haven't been able to find one that suits my workflow exactly how I'd like it to. All suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
