[Inclusive Design 24](http://www.inclusivedesign24.org/) is a free online accessibility conference, organised annually by The Paciello Group. With 24 one-hour webinars from a range of speakers, ID24 is always packed with insights and ideas for beginners and experts alike. The theme this year was about going beyond the basics and beyond compliance, and featured presentations from people at Facebook, Microsoft the BBC. So what did I learn from this year's speakers?

## Accessibility is dead
[Johan Huijkman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ut5NvshO6w), Accessibility Engineer at Q42 in Amsterdam, highlighted the difference between technical conformance and user experience. He argued that thinking about accessibility in isolation isn't enough because accessibility isn't just about designing for people with disabilities but rather designing for specific needs. We should therefore focus on usability for everyone and not accessibility for a few.

## How Facebook scales its accessibility improvements
Facebook has thousands of engineers, an incredible 42,000 React components, and a codebase that doubles in size every 18 months. Facebook can't keep increasing the size of its accessibility team indefinitely. Instead, they aim to scale the effect of their efforts by inspiring, educating and empowering every engineer to take responsibility for accessibility.

## ARIA doesn't always mean "accessible"

## When companies focus solely on #accessibility compliance they are not focused on the people that use their products

## How to make friction fun
