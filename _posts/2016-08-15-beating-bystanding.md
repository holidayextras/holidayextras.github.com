Beating Bystanding
Our engineering team has doubled in size over the last two years. During that time we’ve recruited people who value helping others and embedded them into our supportive culture. So, why is it more difficult to find help? 

We use pull requests (PR) as a strategy to get work reviewed. All code changes are approved by peers before being put into production. The PR process also provides a good measure of our supportive culture. 

We have supportive individuals. We have a well communicated and adopted company culture of supporting others. We have an understanding within our teams that support of others is a necessary part of our delivery. Check to all those. In that respect we have maintained the culture we had two years ago before we doubled in size. Perhaps it is growth itself, particularly our new size, that has created this issue.

There is an interesting social psychological phenomenon called the bystander effect. This effect is linked to some horrific crimes, so be careful with any further reading. The underlying psychology study shows the impact of the size of a group on intervention. Intervention in our case is the process of stepping forward and answering a request for help.

John Darley and Bibb Latané demonstrated bystander effect in a series of experiments in 1968. Their experiments show that in the presence of others an individual is less likely to intervene. The likelihood of stepping forward decreases further the larger the group. The experiments used danger and confrontation to perform their study. There is still much to learn in our less threatening workplaces. It’s at our most vulnerable that we see human impulse the most.

The variables of bystander theory could explain why we are not stepping forward in our growing Holiday Extras tech team.

**Diffusion of responsibility** could be the biggest contributor to our issue. It is tempting to believe that others are more available or capable to intervene. In relation to the PR example, it would be easy for an individual to assume that another member of the team would be more capable. It would be human of us to want to wait a while for that highly capable, highly available person to step forward. As the team grows, the probability of this person increases and so people are more inclined to wait. When all are waiting, including that person, we have a problem. 

A feeling of responsibility is part of the **emergency vs non-emergency** variable. It focuses more on how the situation is presented. Bystanders naturally go through the following process when assessing: notice the situation; interpret the level of emergency; feel a level of responsibility; think how they could help; implement. Given that process, the author of a PR would need to make sure they provide the right information. We use Slack to communicate when we need a PR reviewed, where it’s difficult to get noticed. It would be easy to write “Got a PR, a little help?” and get frustrated that no one understands the urgency or feels responsible. Include that it needs to be merged today, to solve this business goal and here’s the expertise we need to assess. That would help bystanders to go through their process and put themselves forward to help.

One of the ways we’ve considered increasing the feeling of responsibility is to assign system responsibility to teams. This will make it much clearer where responsibility lies. It may also increase **cohesiveness**, which is another variable in bystander theory. It was observed that when familiarity between group members was high they were quicker to intervene. Contributing factors including the sense of “team” and knowing your ability within that group.

These are just three of seven variables identified, but definitely provide us with some actionable things. So, what could we start doing today?

- Get the engineers to read this post. Just knowing how our human instincts impact us can help us feel more responsible.
- Get better visibility of open PRs to help them to be noticed.
- Improve the presentation of our issues in order to help others to assess their suitability.
- Push for platform, or part of platform, ownership to increase.
- Keep pushing our specialisms work so individuals understand where their skills are in relation to the team. 

We hope that if we can put in place these five things, we can overcome the natural difficulties of larger groups finding help so we can keep growing. 

_A little side note to this article. In my career so far I’ve found myself wondering why things are wrong and seen the stick, not the carrot, wielded to fix it. It’s fantastic to be able to have the time and remit to investigate the causes of the issues we face and finding real, long term solutions. If you’re in a reactive, crack-papering environment and looking for the alternative, get in touch._
