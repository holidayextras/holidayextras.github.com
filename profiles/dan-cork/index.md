Dan's love of code began in the early 90s creating 8-bit games and text adventures on his Amstrad.

Since 2008 his focus has been on all things web, with a passion for front-end and mobile UI development. Having worked as Lead Developer for a Kent-based digital agency, Dan joined the expanding web team at Holiday Extras in November 2014.
