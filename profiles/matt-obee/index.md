Matt has worked on a wide range of responsive web, native mobile and in-store projects across a broad spectrum of industries for clients including Topshop, Harrods, Toys R Us, MasterCard, Universal, Joules, Graze, The Entertainer, Iceland, Hornby, Volkswagen, The Natural History Museum, the NHS and the Department of Health. His skills span front end development and UX as well as software testing and so he tries to spend his time at the intersection of those disciplines.

Outside of work, Matt is an Open University student and a keen photographer.
