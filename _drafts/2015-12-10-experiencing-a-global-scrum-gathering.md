title: Experiencing a Global Scrum Gathering
---

Last month I _experienced_ my first **Global Scrum Gathering**. Experience is the right word - Keynote addresses, talks, workshops, coaching clinics, discussions, debates, a drawing masterclass, improv games, food, drink, local culture and singing (yes, singing!). It certainly was an _experience_.

The Gathering was between November 16th and 18th in the beautiful city of Prague.......and yes, I’ve only just managed to find the time the finalise my thoughts on the event! 

It was held at the Hilton hotel and I’ll firstly say that we were fantastically well looked after. Staff were always polite, helpful and very welcoming. The meeting spaces were vast, so there was enough room for everyone not to feel on top of each other. The array of food provided during every break was magnificent - and as a vegetarian, little things like labels for the food was well appreciated. Which brings me on to the general organisation. Logistically, I was never lost for where I needed to be, at what time I needed to be there and always clued up to what I should expect from the sessions - all aided by the Gathering’s mobile App.

Prague was selected for its “Avant-garde Culture”, given that this “is directly aligned with the agile mindset and the Scrum Alliance’s goal of _Transforming the World of Work_”. The Gathering was carefully aligned around the City’s influence. Prague delights all the senses with magnificent architecture & art, music, the smell of fresh Trdelník (a local pastry) and good food served throughout the city. The sessions centred around:
- Touch - The Architecture of Scrum
- Visual - Seeing is Believing
- Auditory - Harmonious Communication.

It’s at this point I remember how lucky (and lazy) I am that no matter whether speaker, facilitator or participant, everyone spoke fluent English. It was very rare for anyone to be unable to get their point across and all written communication was presented and scribed in English. I can only applaud my fellow attendees from all corners of Eastern and Western Europe (and around the world) for their ability to listen, understand and contribute in every session.

So what was the conference all about? It’s run by the Scrum Alliance, an organisation supporting more people every month become certified in Scrum, as the business world recognises the value and productivity Scrum brings to their organisations. The opening addresses spoke about how _mindset_ is more important than _methodology and process_ - Scrum and agile working, certainly drives this way of thinking.

The variety of workshops meant there was something for everyone to go to and me and the two colleagues I attended with, found different sessions to attend throughout each day. One of the key learnings I take away from the Gathering is that our company should send Product Owners, Architects & Engineers and Testers as well as Scrum Masters. The topics covered sometimes leant themselves to these other roles (without focussing too specifically on any role to the extent that any attendee could participate).

I took away some wonderful soundbites and practices to consider from most of the Keynote speeches and sessions I attended. Here’s some of my favourites:

- “Prepare for complexities - complexity is neither good or bad, it just is. Rather things be complex than complicated. Complex is the reason we cannot automate everything as people bring the ideas and solutions to complex issues.”

- “When vision is clear, decision making is easier”

- “Synchronisation as a method can remove the need for daily scrums (stand-ups)”

- The Goal should be “Getting the team to own their own process”

- “You cannot manage emotions, only manipulate”

- “[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0141029196)”

- “Trying to get Personal Alignment in a team is difficult to enable every member to get what they want from it”
	- Connection “Connect great people into a great team, totally cohesive and supporting each other toward shared goals”
	- Productivity “Align together, deliver great products, achieve great results”

- “Avoid Losing Implementation Momentum:
	- Experiment with meeting format
	- Invest in automation
	- Share practices
	- Don’t spend too much time on stabilisation after implementation of Scrum, move quickly on to Progression and Experimentation”

- Economics of Continuous Integration:
	- “Finding a bug is like finding a needle in a haystack - reduce the size of your haystack”
	- “Consider the cost of delay”
	- “Decrease your release cycle time”

- “The principle of Technical Debt is _the actual cost of fixing the shortcuts taken_”

- “Communication is the largest reason for failing the agile transformation”

In summary, a really worthwhile _experience_ whether I was learning new things, considering ways to improve what we do or, as importantly, validating that what we’re already doing works well. It’s one I would recommend to anyone interested in, or practicing, Scrum and I’m looking forward to taking forward some learnings to “progress and experiment”.
